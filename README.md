TortoiseGit - The coolest Interface to Git Version Control
==========================================================

TortoiseGit is a Windows Shell Interface to Git and based on TortoiseSVN. It's open source and can fully be build with freely available software.

TortoiseGit supports you by regular tasks, such as committing, showing logs, diffing two versions, creating branches and tags, creating patches and so on (see our [Screenshots](https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/wiki/Screenshots) or [documentation](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/)).
