\section Introduction Introduction
Compiling TortoiseGit is not very difficult, but it requires several steps
to finish, at least the first time.

Unlike other big open source projects, once you have built all the libraries
TortoiseGit depends on, you can use the familiar VisualStudio IDE to build
and debug the binaries. No need to run the build script for every little change.

So don't give up if you read through the next section and all the requirements.
You only have to do this once.

\section Requirements Requirements

\subsection Requirements1 First, you need to install the compiler package.

-# You need VS2012 with Update 1 (or at least Visual Studio 2010) to allow
   building of the full TortoiseGit package. 
   If you don't have the Update 1 installed for VS2012 you cannot build
   binaries which run on Windows XP.
   This is the recommended option, but it is not free :-(
   If you want to build the msi make sure the "Tools for Redistributing
   Applications" are installed.
-# If you do not have access to VS.NET you can download the free
   Visual C++ 2012 Express Edition.
   This will allow you to build the subversion libraries and the
   TortoiseGitBlame, TortoiseGitUDiff, TortoiseGitIDiff, CrashRpt
   and ResText projects only. You can not build the main parts of
   TortoiseGit(shell extension, TortoiseGitProc, TGitCache, TortoiseGitMerge)
   with the Express Edition!
   - Install Visual C++ 2012 Express Edition.
     Download it from http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/
   - Install MASM 6.15 from: http://win32assembly.online.fr/files/masm615.zip
     and add it to the PATH environment variable
   \note Do not bother to install WiX and Votive as you cannot build very much.

\subsection Requirements2 Next you need to install some utilities/programs.
- WiX3.7                   http://wix.codeplex.com/
.

\section get external source code
git submodule update --init

\section build Building the packages

Open TortoiseGit.sln
Build all projects.

If you want to build the installer package, make sure you build the Win32 configuration before the x64 one.
