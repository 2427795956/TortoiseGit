Grabbing Screenshots for TortoiseGit Docs
=========================================
This file is a guide to grabbing screenshots for the user manual.
Although there are not many hard and fast rules, some screenshots need
care to set up as they are demonstrating a range of features.

To help with consistency, some of these instructions are presented
as a TortoiseGitProc.exe command line. These assume that the TGit
bin directory is in the PATH and that you have a doc folder checked
out at D:\TortoiseGit\Doc. Adjust the path according to your location.

You will also need to ensure that the screenshots are at the correct
DPI setting and size to fit the page. Fortunately this is easy as you
can use the AdjustImages.bat script which does the conversion for you.
This script requires NConvert.exe which you can download from
http://www.xnview.com

From the images directory you can simply run adjustimages to check all
images in all languages - it could take a long time. You can check
specific languages or images using a single parameter, eg.
adjustimages en\*.png
adjustimages en\Rev*.png

Also run PNGGauntlet after that.


General rules for all screenshots
=================================
Use PNG format
8 bit colour depth (256 colours)
Windows 7 style preferred, white background, English Windows (especially for Context Menus)
Use the D:\TortoiseGit repository
If you update a Screenshot please make sure it looks quite similar to the existing one
