	<para>
		A worktree can be seen as an additional checkout of a Git repository (cf. <xref linkend="Git User Manual_def_worktree" />).
	</para>

	<para>
		To create a new worktree, specify a folder. By default for the path the main repo path is selected.
		Modify that to your liking. For example from <filename>C:\Users\jdoe\TortoiseGit</filename> to <filename>C:\Users\jdoe\another-worktree</filename>.

		To specify which revision is checked out, select <guilabel>HEAD</guilabel>, a branch, tag, or a concrete commit.

		A branch can only be checked out at a single worktree.
		Alternatively use <guilabel>Force</guilabel> to check out the branch twice, but this is not recommended.
